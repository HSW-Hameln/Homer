HOMER
=====

Search framework that uses Ontologies

Homer is a framework that is build on top of a search engine and a triplestore. In this implementation the search engine is elasticsearch and the triplestore is Apache Fuseki. The Framework serves a RESTfull interface that extends elasticsearch's Lucene DSL with the possibility of embedding SPARQL queries. This approach enables the user to generate complex queries from a semantic structure.
